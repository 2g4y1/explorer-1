    "description": "<p>A message is a data structure that is actually being broadcast in the IOTA 1.5 network and represents a node  in the Tangle graph.</p><p>It refers to at least 2 and up to 8 previous messages and once a message is attached to the Tangle and approved by a milestone, the Tangle structure ensures the content of the message is unaltered. Every message is referenced by a message_id which is based on a hash algorithm (Blake2b256) of binary content of the message. It also includes previous Tangle messages as its parents which means it is not possible to alter the given message without altering previous messages in the Tangle. The message is an atomic unit that is confirmed by the network as a whole.</p> <p>A message can be up to 32 kb in size and it can hold variable sets of information called payloads. The number of payloads a single message can encapsulate is not given. Even a message without a payload is completely valid and can be broadcast. The Message itself does not include any timestamp; a message timestamp is derived from an acceptance of the given message by the Tangle network. IOTA network ensures the outer structure of the message itself is valid and strictly complies with network consensus protocol. However, the inner structure is very flexible, future-proof, and offers an unmatched network extensibility.</p>"
