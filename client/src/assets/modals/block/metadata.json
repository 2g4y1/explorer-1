Smart contract requests make use of it to encode the actual request call data that is only interpreted on L2.</p><p>Of course, there is a limit on how much data one can store in an output, as outputs are part of transactions that have a limited size. Anyway, bigger data can always be sliced up into chunks to be stored in outputs.</p"
