    "description": "<p>Stardust introduces custom, user-defined tokens. Fungible tokens, called native tokens, are minted and melted in token foundries. One does not need to convert base currency into native tokens, they are injected into the ledger out of thin air. Anyone is free to issue their own tokens, but keep in mind that holding native tokens in one's wallet increases the required storage deposit in the base currency.</p>",
